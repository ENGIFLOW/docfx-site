### Intro: The Rise of Automation in Modern Infrastructure

The automation of mechanical and electrical systems is ubiquitous in commercial buildings and industrial facilities. This trend is sharply rising as we build increasingly larger and smarter systems. Today, we will delve into how these systems are controlled and the pivotal role played by programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Sponsored by Teli Controls, leaders in the automation industry since 1963, this video will cover everything you need to know about PLCs and how they interact with other core components in automation.

### What is a PLC?

A Programmable Logic Controller, or PLC, is essentially a specialized computer used to control industrial and commercial processes. These devices are designed to operate under harsh conditions and read inputs from various sensors, then make logic-based decisions to control outputs automatically.

### Historical Context: From Relays to PLCs

Before the advent of PLCs, industries relied on cumbersome banks of relays for process control. Each relay was dedicated to specific inputs and outputs, connected via physical wiring. These setups were not only vast and complex but also inflexible and challenging to modify or troubleshoot. With the development of solid-state electronics, the transition to PLCs equipped with software logic replaced these large, unwieldy relay setups.

### Core Components of PLCs

#### Input Modules

Input modules are crucial as they handle signals from various sensors (digital or analog) and translate these into signals the PLC can process. They also protect the PLC from signal fluctuations which ensures stable operation.

#### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU acts as the brain of a PLC, running the control software that processes inputs and determines the required outputs. It consists of a processor, memory chips for data and program storage, and other integrated circuits for communication and monitoring.

#### Output Modules

These modules convert the CPU's command signals into actionable output that can control machinery or actuate other devices in the field. Outputs can include turning on lights, activating motors, or opening valves.

### Practical Applications of PLCs

PLCs find applications in numerous fields. Here are a few examples:
- **Baggage Handling Systems:** PLCs scan baggage tags and route luggage based on programmed instructions.
- **Manufacturing:** Automated assembly lines use PLCs for precision control of machinery, ensuring efficient, error-free production.

### Advanced PLC Functions

PLCs can handle more than simple on/off tasks; they can implement complex algorithms like PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control. This function allows precise control over variables such as temperature, pressure, and other operational parameters by adjusting the control elements incrementally.

### Future of PLCs

As systems continue to grow in complexity, the role of PLCs is becoming more sophisticated. Innovations like networked PLCs and integration with IoT devices pave the way for smarter automation solutions.

### Conclusion

PLCs are indispensable in the modern automated world. From simplifying control processes to enhancing system efficiencies, their impact is profound and will only expand as technology evolves.
